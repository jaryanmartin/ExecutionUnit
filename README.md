# Execution Unit (VHDL)

## Overview
This repository contains the VHDL implementation of a processor execution unit developed as part of a computer architecture course project. The design focuses on the **execute (EX) stage** of a processor datapath and includes arithmetic, logic, shift, and comparison functionality, along with supporting modules for operand preparation and result selection.

The project emphasizes correctness, modular design, and hardware trade-offs, with designs evaluated through simulation and analysis of speed and area (LUT usage).


## Features

### Arithmetic Units
- Ripple Carry Adder  
- Brent–Kung Adder  
- Carry-skip Adder  

### Logic & Shift Operations
- AND / OR logic  
- Logical and arithmetic shifts  
- Shift selection logic  

## Verification & Evaluation
- Test Vectors and Simulation transcripts included  
- Designs evaluated based on correctness, timing behavior, and resource usage
